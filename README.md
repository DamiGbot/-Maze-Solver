# Maze-Solver

Maze Solver is a Python program designed to generate and solve mazes. Given a maze, the program will attempt to find a solution and output whether the maze is solvable or not. This project aims to provide an interactive way to explore and understand maze-solving algorithms.

## Features

- Maze generation: Creates random mazes for the solver to process.
- Maze solving: Attempts to solve the generated mazes using a specific algorithm.
- Output: Displays the solution if the maze is solvable, or a message indicating the maze cannot be solved.

## Algorithm

Maze Solver uses the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm to explore and solve the mazes. The DFS algorithm starts at the entrance of the maze and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. 

## Usage 

To start using the Maze Solver, execute the main script and follow the prompts to generate a maze and attempt to solve it:

```shell
python main.py
```
